This repository hosts my submission for https://2018.js13kgames.com/.

My game is about coding a robot to run offline, originally inspired by https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding.

Current development version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2018/

The game is free software, so you can copy and re-use it, but of course you are not allowed to submit my game, that's against the rules of the competition. But you can use parts of it in your game, e.g. storage.js.
