Robot Coder is a game about coding a robot to run offline.

You enter the code for the robot to move and to bring items to different targets. Then you start it, and it will run without any way by you to interfere in what it’s doing. So you have to plan ahead to make sure the robot runs the way you want it to run.

Features:

* The game starts with some tutorial levels to help you learn how to run the robot.
* Once you unlock them, there are many more levels, both easy and difficult.
* Your progress is saved, so you can always come back and try to improve your previous results.
* The game has an integrated editor (you are required to solve some levels first to unlock it), that allows you to create, play and share your own levels.
* To input the code for the robot, you can use both an integrated virtual keyboard and your real keyboard.
* The game should run in most browsers (even old ones), and also on mobile. If the game looks broken on mobile, try to zoom a bit.
* There also is a version that will work when you are offline, at https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2018/min/offline.html. I decided to make this a separate version, because you probably don’t want lots of games to fill your cache. So it is up to you whether you want to use the offline version or not.
